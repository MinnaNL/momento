Frontend project and agile methods. We used trello as project manager.

In this school project, the assignment was to create an application that facilitates productivity in everyday life. Users should be able to keep track of their daily routines, tasks, and enable focused work. 

## Features:

### Login:

Users can register with a username and password.
Users can log in and out of the application.
Upon successful login, users are greeted with a message and a random quote.
Each user has access to all their tasks and routines when they log in.

### Tasks (todos):

#### Users can see a list of tasks to complete.

- Each task includes:
- Title
- Description
- Status (completed or not)
- Deadline
- Time estimate
- Category (e.g., health, household, work-related, - entertainment)

#### Users can:

- Create tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Edit tasks

#### Users can filter and sort the list based on:

- Status
- Category
- Deadline
- Time estimate

### Daily Routines (habits):

#### Users can see a list of daily routines they can perform and see a "habit streak" (number of consecutive days the user performed the routine).

#### Each routine includes:

Title (e.g., exercise, read a book, meditate)
Streak (number of consecutive days the user performed the routine)
Priority (low, medium, high)

#### Users can:

- Create new routines and delete existing routines.
- Increase, decrease, and reset the streak for each routine.
- Filter by priority.
- Sort by:
- Habit streak
- Priority

#### Nice-to-have features:

- Pomodoro timer functionality
- Weather functionality
- Calendar functionality
