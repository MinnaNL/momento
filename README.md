Frontend project and agile methods. We used trello as project manager.

In this school project, the assignment was to create an application that facilitates productivity in everyday life. Users should be able to keep track of their daily routines, tasks, and enable focused work. 

## Features:

Login
Register
Todos
Habits
Weather
Calender
Pomodoro timer

### Login:

Users can register with a username and password.
Users can log in and out of the application.
Upon successful login, users are greeted with a message and a random quote.
Each user has access to all their tasks and routines when they log in.

### Tasks (todos):

- Each task includes:

### Daily Routines (habits):
